# Secure Coding in Ruby

_[[Epistemic status\|Epistemic status]]_: Medium. I've been working in Ruby for 15+ years, though I haven't drilled super far down into secure coding practices
_[[Epistemic effort\|Epistemic effort]]_: Lots of time learning Ruby & I've picked up secure coding practices along the way. I'm just starting to focus specifically on identifying secure coding practices, though.
